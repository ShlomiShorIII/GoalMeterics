# GoalMetrics

## Overview
*GoalMetrics* is an application that provides users with comprehensive data on football leagues. Users can select from a total of 8 leagues to receive current season statistics, league tables, and top scorers. The application generates visualizations and CSV files to make data analysis more accessible.

## Features
- **Team Statistics**: Input a team's name to receive its current season statistics, including the number of wins, league position, losses, and more.
- **League Tables**: Based on the leagues the user selects, the application displays the current tables for each league.
- **Top Scorers**: Identifies the top-scoring team and player across the selected leagues.
- **Data Output**: Provides graphical visualizations and exports specific data as CSV files.

## How to Use
1. **Prepare a Text File**: Create a text file (e.g., `leagues.txt`) listing the leagues you want to load (e.g., “Premier League,” “La Liga,” etc.). This file tells the application which leagues to focus on.
